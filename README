This is all a bit of a work in progress.

Manjaro KDE theme, based on Adapta Breath Nokto, and inspired by the post "[Mechanial Love](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/a900p7/awesome_mechanical_love/ecfdc1a/)" by EmpressNoodle, on Reddit.

So far, only the Splash screen is implemented. I don't recommend anyone but me using this for now.
